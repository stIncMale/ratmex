# RatMeX
**RatMeX** is a Java library that supplies a rate meter and a **Rat**e-**M**easuring **eX**ecutor based on it. This library is designed to be:
* high-performance (is able to register 23+ millions of concurrent events per second with less than 180ns latency per registration)
* garbage collector friendly (there is an implementation that does not produce garbage)
* free of external dependencies

Documentation is available [here](https://github.com/stIncMale/ratmex/wiki).

**This library is still a work in progress.**
