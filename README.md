This is a work in progress that can be seen at https://github.com/stIncMale/sandbox/tree/master/rateExecutor
As for now, I have created RateMeter that is able to measure [20_000_000+ concurrent ticks per second](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ixv2IvjMTaZWAnUX04SAl08rmcf4eglLUXmKef00kSs/edit?usp=sharing)(there is [a video presentation in Russian](https://youtu.be/zEz99aipRQo)).
