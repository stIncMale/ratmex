/**
 * This {@link RateMeasuringExecutorService} assigns two roles to its threads: submitter and worker.
 * Threads belonging to different roles are organized in two {@link ExecutorService}'s named submitter and worker.
 * A submitter submits tasks to a worker with the target rate. A worker executes the submitted tasks as fast as it can.
 * If the worker manages to continuously execute all the tasks being submitted without accumulating them,
 * then the tasks are not only being submitted but also are being completed with the target rate.
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation notes</b><br>
 * This class uses {@link RateMeter} to measure rate.
 * <p>
 * A submitter always has exactly 1 thread, and a worker may have an arbitrary fixed number of threads
 * including 0 and varying number of threads.
 * If a worker has no threads, then a submitter takes over the worker role and executes tasks by itself.
 * <p>
 * Submitting tasks by a submitter to a worker means that the submitter and the worker threads communicate.
 * Inter-thread communication is always bad for performance, so it should be reduced to a minimum.
 * In order to do so a submitter organizes tasks in batches before submitting them to a worker.
 * Batching allows submitting multiple tasks to a worker via a single {@linkplain ExecutorService#execute(Runnable) act of communication}
 * between a submitter and a worker. However such a technique should be used with caution,
 * because it may induce an uneven load on worker threads and hence lead to a violation of the target rate of completion of tasks.
 * In order to use batching a submitter must know the number of worker threads (which must be fixed)
 * and distribute batched tasks evenly among worker threads.
 *
 * @param <C> A type of scheduled task config used in {@link #scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable, Rate, C)}.
 * @param <E> A type of container with data provided to a {@linkplain ScheduledTaskConfig#getRateListenerSupplier() rate listener}.
 * @param <SRS> A type that represents {@linkplain RateMeter#stats() statistics} of submitter {@link RateMeter}.
 * @param <WRS> A type that represents {@linkplain RateMeter#stats() statistics} of worker {@link RateMeter}.
